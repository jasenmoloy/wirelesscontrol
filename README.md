# Wireless Control

* Do you ever forget to turn off your WiFi or Bluetooth when you travel?
* How about squeezing the most battery you can get when you're using your phone around town all day?
* Don't want to think about switching things on and off on the go?

Wireless Control will automatically toggle your WiFi and/or Bluetooth when you enter/leave designated areas you specify.

## Current Status

This app is very alpha and nowhere near a running state yet. Currently there's only test data being loaded which provides a proof of concept that location-based events are working properly.

It's currently here to show my progress, coding style, and commit methods for other engineers to get a feel for how I work.

My primary technological goal is to experiment with Android APIs, Material Design, and the full project cycle of an Android app.
